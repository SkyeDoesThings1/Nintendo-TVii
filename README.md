# Nintendo TVii (Until I think of a cooler name)

# How do I install this
Currently you can't install this on a Wii U due to Nintendo Networks shut down. Until Pretendo releases 3rd party account servers you need can use it on the site https://vino.stupidverse.xyz. Sorry!

## What was/is Nintendo TVii?
Nintendo TVii was a streaming service that came pre-installed on the Nintendo Wii U. It launched on December 8, 2012, in Japan and December 20, 2012, in North America. Unfortunately, it never launched in Europe due to licensing issues. The service was discontinued on August 11, 2015, in North America and November 7, 2017, in Japan.

## What did it do?
Nintendo TVii was part of the now-defunct Nintendo Network. It allowed users to watch shows from Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and their cable network. While watching live TV, Nintendo held polls and allowed users doodle on the screen. The service also integrated with many social medias such as, Miiverse, Facebook, and Twitter, and earn points by predicting plays during sports events.

## How was TVii launched?
Nintendo TVii was accessible directly from the Wii U Menu, located between the Internet Browser and Notifications. However, this icon was removed on August 17, 2015.

## How will I access it if it was removed? Will I have to region change??
No! Although Nintendo TVii was removed from the Wii U menu, the applet is still installed on your Wii U. Currently, there are three main ways to access it (Guides for these methods will be added later):

### Downgrading the Wii U/HOME Menus (Recommended):
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Brings back the Nintendo TVii icons on the main and pause menu | Slightly difficult |
| Brings back the jumpy icons from earlier versions while having all 7 icons | Requires a Raspberry Pi Pico or Switch capable of running payloads |

### Men.rpx:
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Very simple to do | Will only be added to the main menu, not the pause menu |
| | Will not have jumpy icons |
| | Will not work on Tiramisu or other legacy homebrew environments unless sdcaffiine is manually launched every time |
| | Breaks daily log |

### TVii WHUB (Not recommended):
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Very simple to do | Will show up as an app on your menu (e.g., Mii Maker) |
| | Takes up one of the limited menu spaces |
| | Just use Men.rpx if you don't want to buy a Pico |

## Additional Features and Integration
While watching TVii, users could access settings by tapping the Mii icon in the top right corner to adjust their favorites, TV provider, and select which social networks to post to. Users could also find other users' posts using the "tvtag" feature.
